My Name is Dionte Scott(kiyanna) I am 17 years old and in 12th grade.I plan on getting into real estate and finnace classesw to earn my liscense in order to join a brokage after high school.
I saw multiple people online and around me who were into real estate and was interested in the diffrent types of finances that were related with real estate since i love doing math
 and algebra.Now i look forward to owning ,hopefully,my own firm one day or atleast buying an apartment building and renting it out to customers.
