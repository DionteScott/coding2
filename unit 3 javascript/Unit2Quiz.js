// long a password is. Your program should be able to accept a alpha-numeric password and check if the password is more or less than 10 
// characters long. if the password is longer than 10 characters, your program should tell the user that their password is too long. If the 
// password is under 4 characters the function should tell the user the password is too short. If the password meets the length criteria,
//  there should be a message confirming to the user that their password was created successfully.
